## Motivation

Clojure's built-in data structures get you a long way when trying to codify and solve difficult problems. A solid selection of core functions allow you to easily create and access core data structures. Unfortunately, this flexibility does not extend to testing: we seem to be missing a comprehensive yet extensible way to assert that the data fits a particular structure.

This library addresses this issue by providing composable matcher combinators that can be used as building blocks to test functions that evaluate to nested data-structures more effectively.

## Features

- Matchers for scalar and structural values
  - Good readability supported by default interpretations of Clojure types as matchers
- Pretty-printed diffs when the actual result doesn't match the expected matcher
- Integration with `clojure.test` and `midje`

## Usage

### `clojure.test`

Require the `matcher-combinators.test` namespace, which will extend `clojure.test`'s `is` macro to accept the `match?` and `thrown-match?` directives.

 - `match?`: The first argument should be the matcher-combinator represented the expected value, and the second argument should be the expression being checked.
 - `thrown-match?`: The first argument should be a throwable subclass, the second a matcher-combinators, and the third the expression being checked.

For example:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
         '[matcher-combinators.test] ;; adds support for `match?` and `thrown-match?` in `is` expressions
         '[matcher-combinators.matchers :as m])

(deftest test-matching-with-explicit-matchers
  (is (match? (m/equals 37) (+ 29 8)))
  (is (match? (m/regex #"fox") "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")))

(deftest test-matching-scalars
  ;; most scalar values are interpreted as an `equals` matcher
  (is (match? 37 (+ 29 8)))
  (is (match? "this string" (str "this" " " "string")))
  (is (match? :this/keyword (keyword "this" "keyword")))
  ;; regular expressions are handled specially
  (is (match? #"fox" "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")))

(deftest test-matching-sequences
  ;; A sequence is interpreted as an `equals` matcher, which specifies
  ;; count and order of matching elements. The elements, themselves,
  ;; are matched based on their types.
  (is (match? [1 3] [1 3]))
  (is (match? [1 odd?] [1 3]))
  (is (match? [#"red" #"violet"] ["Roses are red" "Violets are ... violet"]))

  ;; use m/prefix when you only care about the first n items
  (is (match? (m/prefix [odd? 3]) [1 3 5]))

  ;; use m/in-any-order when order doesn't matter
  (is (match? (m/in-any-order [odd? odd? even?]) [1 2 3]))

  ;; NOTE: in-any-order is O(n!) because it compares every expected element
  ;; with every actual element in order to find a best-match for each one,
  ;; removing matched elements from both sequences as it goes.
  ;; Avoid applying this to long sequences.
  )

(deftest test-matching-sets
  ;; A set is also interpreted as an `equals` matcher.
  (is (match? #{1 2 3} #{3 2 1}))
  (is (match? #{odd? even?} #{1 2}))
  ;; use m/set-equals to repeat predicates
  (is (match? (m/set-equals [odd? odd? even?]) #{1 2 3}))

  ;; NOTE: matching sets is an O(n!) operation because it compares every
  ;; expected element with every actual element in order to find a best-match
  ;; for each one, removing matched elements from both sets as it goes.
  ;; Avoid applying this to large sets.
  )

(deftest test-matching-maps
  ;; A map is interpreted as an `embeds` matcher, which ignores
  ;; un-specified keys
  (is (match? {:name/first "Alfredo"}
              {:name/first  "Alfredo"
               :name/last   "da Rocha Viana"
               :name/suffix "Jr."}))))

(deftest test-matching-nested-datastructures
  ;; Maps, sequences, and sets follow the same semantics whether at
  ;; the top level or nested within a structure.
  (is (match? {:band/members [{:name/first "Alfredo"}
                              {:name/first "Benedito"}]}
              {:band/members [{:name/first  "Alfredo"
                               :name/last   "da Rocha Viana"
                               :name/suffix "Jr."}
                              {:name/first "Benedito"
                               :name/last  "Lacerda"}]
               :band/recordings []})))

(deftest test-matching-transformed-value-via-via
  ;; via applies read-string to the actual value "{:foo :bar}" before
  ;; matching against the expected value {:foo :bar}
  (is (match? {:payloads [(m/via read-string {:foo :bar})]}
              {:payloads [\"{:foo :bar}\"]})))

(deftest exception-matching
  (is (thrown-match? clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo
                     {:foo 1}
                     (throw (ex-info "Boom!" {:foo 1 :bar 2})))))
```

### Midje:

We've deprecated support for [Midje](https://github.com/marick/midje) in `matcher-combinators`. We continue to ship with the `matcher-combinators.midje` namespace to avoid breaking changes, but we no longer include `midje` as a transitive dependency.

### Standalone:

The `matcher-combinators.standalone` namespace provides an API for using matcher-combinators outside the context of a test framework.

## Matchers

### Default matchers

When an expected value isn't wrapped in a specific matcher the default interpretation is:
- all scalar and collection types except regex and maps: `equals`
- regex: `regex`
- map: `embeds`

You can use the `matcher-for` function to discover which matcher would be used
for a specific value, e.g.

``` clojure
(require '[matcher-combinators.matchers :as matchers])

(matchers/matcher-for {:this :map})
;; => #function[matcher-combinators.matchers/embeds]
```

### built-in matchers

- `equals` operates over any scalar value or collection
  - scalars: matches when the given value is exactly the same as the `expected`.
  - map: matches when
      1. the keys of the `expected` map are equal to the given map's keys
      2. the value matchers of `expected` map matches the given map's values 
         - Note: Given that the default matcher for maps is `embeds`, nested maps continue being matched with embeds (instead of also being matched with `equals`). Check out 'Overriding default matchers' below for instructions on how to match nested maps with equals too.
  - sequence: matches when the `expected` sequences's matchers match the given sequence. Similar to midje's `(just expected)`
  - set: matches when all the elements in the given set can be matched with a matcher in `expected` set and each matcher is used exactly once.
- `embeds` operates over maps, sequences, and sets
  - map: matches when the map contains some of the same key/values as the `expected` map.
  - sequence: order-agnostic matcher that will match when provided a subset of the `expected` sequence. Similar to midje's `(contains expected :in-any-order :gaps-ok)`
  - set: matches when all the matchers in the `expected` set can be matched with an element in the provided set. There may be more elements in the provided set than there are matchers.
- `prefix` operates over sequences

  matches when provided a (ordered) prefix of the `expected` sequence. Similar to midje's `(contains expected)`
- `in-any-order` operates over sequences

  matches when the given a sequence that is the same as the `expected` sequence but with elements in a different order.  Similar to midje's `(just expected :in-any-order)`

- `set-equals`/`set-embeds` similar behavior to `equals`/`embeds` for sets, but allows one to specify the matchers using a sequence so that duplicate matchers are not removed. For example, `(equals #{odd? odd?})` becomes `(equals #{odd})`, so to get around this one should use `(set-equals [odd? odd])`.

- `seq-of` takes an expected matcher and creates a new matcher over a sequence, where each element matches the provided expected matcher. Analogous to `clojure.core/every?`, although seq-of expects a non-empty sequence.

- `any-of` given any number of matchers, successfully matches if at least one of them matches.

- `all-of` given any number of matchers, successfully matches if all of them match.

- `regex`: matches the `actual` value when provided an `expected-regex` using `(re-find expected-regex actual)`

- `match-with`: overrides default matchers for `expected` (scalar or arbitrarily deep structure) (see Overriding default matchers, below)

- `within-delta`: matches numeric values that are within `expected` +/- `delta` (inclusive)

#### `via` matcher: transform the `actual` before matching

In some cases one might want to match a serialized string against a parsed data-structure.

Without help this might look like the following, which becomes tedious for deeply nested structures:

```clojure
(let [result {:payloads ["{:foo :bar :baz :qux}"]}]
 (is (match? {:payloads [{:foo :bar}]}
      (update result :payloads (partial map read-string)))))
```

The `via` matcher can help us out with this:

```clojure
(let [result {:payloads ["{:foo :bar :baz :qux}"]}]
  (is (match? {:payloads [(m/via read-string {:foo :bar})]}
              {:payloads result})))
```

`via`, when paired with `match-with`, can be used to apply `actual` pre-processing before applying an underlying matcher:

```clojure
(testing "using `match-with` + `via` we can sort the actual result before matching"
  (is (match? (m/match-with
               [vector? (fn [expected] (m/via sort expected))]
               {:payloads [1 2 3]})
              {:payloads (shuffle [3 2 1])}))))
```

In this example we decorate `vector?`'s matcher to first sort the `actual` and then do matching.
When operating over sort-able values this can be a stand-in for the computationally slower `in-any-order`.

#### negative matchers

Negative matchers, that is, those asserting the absence of something, are generally discouraged due to the adverse effect they can have on code readability.

- `mismatch`: negation matcher that takes in an `expected` matcher and passes when it doesn't match the `actual`. For example, to assert the absence of an entry in a list `(is (match? (mismatch (embeds [odd?])) actual))`. Considering the mental burden of reasoning about negation, please use sparingly.
- `absent`: for use in the context of maps. Matches when the actual map is missing the key pointing to the `absent` matcher. For example `(is (match? {:a absent :b 1} {:b 1}))` matches but `(is (match? {:a absent :b 1} {:a 0 :b 1}))` won't. `absent` should only be used when the absence of a key is behaviourly important.

##### readability concerns with negation matchers

```clojure
(deftest avoid-negative-matchers
  (testing "normal assertion that `:a` is present"
    (match? {:a any?}
            actual))
  (testing "double negation version"
    (match? (matcher-combinators.matchers/mismatch {:a matcher-combinators.matchers/absent})
            actual)))
```

### building new matchers

You can extend your data-types to work with `matcher-combinators` by implemented the [`Matcher` protocol](https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators/blob/afdb64012757719bb699c2a7a3d9d8c2f06a9d32/src/cljc/matcher_combinators/core.cljc#L8-L18).

In the `Matcher` protocol `-name` and `-matcher-for` are largely boilerplate while the important implementation is `-match`, who should return a map adhering to the [result spec](https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators/blob/afdb64012757719bb699c2a7a3d9d8c2f06a9d32/src/cljc/matcher_combinators/result.cljc#L14).

## Overriding default matchers

Inside the context of `match?` (clojure.test) / `match` (midje), data-structures are assigned default matchers, which eliminates the need to wrap data-structures with matcher-combinators when your desired matching behavior matches the defaults.

But what if your desired matching behavior deviates from the defaults?

For example, if you want to do exact map matching you need to use a log of `m/equals`:

```clojure
(deftest exact-map-matching-by-hand
  (is (match? (m/equals {:a (m/equals {:b (m/equals {:c odd?})})})
              {:a {:b {:c 1}}}))
  ;; without m/equals, the system defaults to m/embeds for maps,
  ;; which has looser matching properties
  (is (match? {:a {:b {:c odd?}}}
              {:a {:b {:c 1 :extra-c 0} :extra-b 0} :extra-a 0})))
```

This verbosity can be avoided by redefining the matcher data-type defaults using the `match-with` matcher:

``` clojure
(deftest exact-map-matching-with-match-with
  (is (match? (m/match-with [map? m/equals] {:a {:b {:c odd?}}}))
              {:a {:b {:c 1}}}))
```
